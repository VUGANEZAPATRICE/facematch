VGG face: VGG face archetecture: is a model=>we can use that for extracting features
you can save this algorithm to detect gender,ethnicity,hair color, complexion,facial hair style
or amd age.
#creating an environment not in c
conda create --prefix ./env -y => -y because it is in one time=directly
activate that environment

1. Create recommender txt file that contains all required files

touch requirements.txt  /batch terminal
mtcnn==0.1.0 : It is a face detection and alignment using multi-task cascaded Convolutional Network(MTCNN)

Creating other file setup.py=>because we need local package(not to publish) but it will help to keep some utility files
in setup, name ="src"=> this folder will keep all utility tools

=mkdir src
=touch __init__.py
=mkdir src/utils
=touch src/utils/__init__.py
=touch src/utils/all_utils.py
touch params.yaml
mkdir config
touch config/config.yaml

Moving the file into src folder

mv 14_generate_img_pkl.py(name of the file) /src

CONFIGURING: Whatever I will generete will be inside artifacts
